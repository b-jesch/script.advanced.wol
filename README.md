The Addon can be launched manually from the Programs-section of Kodi (and thus added to your favourites, etc.), and can also be configured in the addon-settings to autostart with Kodi, thus waking up your remote device when Kodi starts.
There is also a setting that will also send a wake-up signal, if Kodi comes out from standby/sleep/suspend.

When autostarted with Kodi you can also set the addon to update the video- and/or music-libraries automatically after a successful wake-up.
You can also set up a delay for the library scans. This is needed, if the filesystem needs some further time to get ready after a successful wake-up.
